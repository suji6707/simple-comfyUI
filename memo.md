  Summary

  I successfully resolved the Docker startup issues by fixing several problems:

  1. Fixed celery command paths: Updated docker-compose.yml to use globally installed celery instead of
  /app/.venv/bin/celery
  2. Added missing environment variables: Added SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY to all celery services
  3. Added missing dependency: Added psycopg2-binary to requirements.txt for PostgreSQL connectivity
  4. Fixed SQLAlchemy issue: Renamed the metadata column to result_metadata in the database model (SQLAlchemy 2.x
  reserves the metadata attribute)
  5. Fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility: Replaced deprecated regex parameter with pattern in field validation
  6. Fixed circular import: Removed direct import of generate_image from GenerationService and used
  celery_app.send_task() instead
  7. Added flower dependency: Added flower==2.0.1 to requirements.txt for Celery monitoring
